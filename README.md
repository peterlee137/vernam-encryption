# vernam-encryption

i learned about vernam cipher and decided to make a vernam encryptor and decryptor

use the vernam encoder to encode your line of text
use the vernam decoder to decode the encoded line of text

only one line of text can be encoded at a time
languages other than english which do not use alphabet are not likely to work
